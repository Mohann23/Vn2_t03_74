====================
2.Python is an interpreted language explain? How is Python an interpreted language?How do we interpret Python?
A. An interpreter is a kind of program that executes other programs. When you write Python programs , it converts source code written by the developer into intermediate language which is again translated into the native language / machine language that is executed.

===================

Exception-Handling Keywords: try, except, raise, finally, else, assert
Asynchronous Programming Keywords: async, await
Variable Handling Keywords: del, global, nonlocal

=====================
9.What are comments and how can you add comments in Python?
A. Comments can be used to explain Python code. Comments can be used to make the code more readable. Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.
=====================

10.How to check Python Version in CMD?
A.  python -V
=============

11.How is memory managed in Python?
A.Python uses a portion of the memory for internal use and Non-Object memory.The other portion is dedicated to object storage like int,dict etc.....
>> We us id() to access the address of the object.
=================

12.how the variable assignment happens in python a=10
A.10 is first converted into binary form and then the binary form will be given a memory location and after that memory location is assigned to the a's memory location.
